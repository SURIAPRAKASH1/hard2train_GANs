# *GANs - ðŸ‘‘dom of Generative Models*
  * *Generative Adversarial Networks simply GAN's are powerfull generative models that can model the distribution ðŸ–¼ of Real data.*
  * *GAN's are defacto for realistic Image generation until the araise of diffusion models ðŸ§ ðŸ¦¾.*
  * *GAN's has two models* **Generator** *and* **Discriminator.** 
  * *Generator try to generate images that are very close to real and Discriminator (act as classifier) try to distinguish from Real/Fake images distripution.*
  * *GAN's are learned by playing **minmax game**.Where Generator try to minimize the difference b/w real and fake at the same time Discriminator try to maximize the difference b/w real and fake.*
